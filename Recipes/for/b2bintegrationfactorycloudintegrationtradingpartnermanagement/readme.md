<p>The [B2B Integration Factory] Integration packages  offer additional features that are currently not yet supported by the B2B Capabilities @ SAP Integration Suite and the standard integration package "Cloud Integration - Trading Partner Management V2". These features are implemented through extensions in the integration flows or through scripts incorporated into the flows.</p>
<p> For more information about the standard integration package "Cloud Integration - Trading Partner Management V2", see:
</p>

[Cloud Integration - Trading Partner Management V2 standard package](https://api.sap.com/package/CloudIntegrationTradingPartnerManagementV2/overview)

<p> The extensions are regularly reviewed against the released standard features in the B2B Capabilities @ SAP
Integration Suite and will be removed once a standard feature covers the exact same use case. The B2B
Integration Factory will also be adding further extensions to the Integration Packages in upcoming releases
based on demand. You can influence this decision by submitting a request on the GitHub page for
the [B2B Integration Factory] Integration Packages.</p>
