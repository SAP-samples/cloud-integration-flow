Sample to showcase connectivity to Azure Blob Storage using SAP Private Link Service with Application Router as a Proxy

<p>With the help of the SAP Private Link service, Azure Blob storage can now be linked to SAP Integration Suite Cloud Integration, enabling the easy exchange of massive amounts of unstructured data like images and documents. This integration provides a secure solution for businesses that need to transfer unstructured data between the two platforms.</p>
<p>The main idea of this package is to use the Application Router as a proxy for the private connectivity between Azure Blob Storage and SAP Integration Suite Cloud Integration.&nbsp;</p>
